# 3Dprintables_electrophoresis
3D models for gel electrophoresis equipment

The usual caveats apply to stuff you find online -- these files are for testing purposes only and were created for my edification. If you find them useful, great! Let me know :)

# Getting started
- Download and install OpenSCAD.
- Download and open on the of the .scad files
- Edit the code as you wish. Press F5 to refresh the preview model as you go.
- Press F6 to render the model, ready for export as and STL file, ready for printing or conversion to your printer's format.

# Agarose Gel Comb
Put in your own dimensions and options to create a customised comb. Match an existing comb's dimensions to create one that will fit existing equipment. Option: include a small lane at each end of the gel, for loading ladder. This is useful if you've specified large wells and you'd rather not waste a pile of ladder in them.

# Agarose Gel Casting Tray
Use your gel-tray and comb dimensions to create a customised casting tray which will accept your custom comb. You can probably 3D-print this tray but it's probably cheaper (and more robust, depending on your print material!) to order in some custom-cut polycarbonate or acrylic sheets and glue them together yourself. If printing this out, you might want to thicken the walls up to keep the structure sound (i.e. keep the sides on!).

# Coming soon (maybe?)
  - plans for a casting tray clamp/holder (for casting gels) 
  - maybe an electrophoresis tank.
