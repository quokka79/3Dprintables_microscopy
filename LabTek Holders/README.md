# LabTek II Holders
LabTek II chamber slides are great but they come with a super-annoying plastic tab at one end of the base. This means you can't just plonk them onto a regular slide-stage. The tab gets in the way and doesn't allow the chamber to sit level.

So I modelled this holder which makes a LabTek II compatible with any stage holder that will accept regular microscope slides.

It is also good for general handling of the chamber slide, such as in tissue culture incubators where the metal shelving can scratch the bare coverglass.
