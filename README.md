# 3Dprintables_science
3D models for various bench science ... microscopy sample chambers, gel electrophoresis pieces.
New things are added as I realise I need them!

The usual caveats apply to stuff you find online -- these files are for testing purposes only and were created for my edification. If you find them useful, great! Let me know :)

# Getting started
- Download and install [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/ "OpenSCAD"); it's free.
- Download and open one the of the .scad files
- Edit the code as you wish; some of these models can adapt themselves to suit your needs.
- As you make changes, press F5 to refresh the preview model and see how things are changing.
- When you are finished, press F6 to render the model.
- The rendered model is now ready for export as and STL file.
- Use the STL file with your printer (or open it in your printer's software for conversion)
