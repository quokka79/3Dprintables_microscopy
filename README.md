3D models for various bench science ... microscopy sample chambers, gel electrophoresis pieces.
New things are added as I realise I need them!

The usual caveats apply to stuff you find online -- these files are for testing purposes only and were created for my edification. If you find them useful, great! Let me know :)

# Getting started
- Download and install OpenSCAD.
- Download and open on the of the .scad files
- Edit the code as you wish. Press F5 to refresh the preview model as you go.
- Press F6 to render the model, ready for export as and STL file, ready for printing or conversion to your printer's format.
