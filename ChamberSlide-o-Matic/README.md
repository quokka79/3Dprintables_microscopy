# Customisable Chamber slide for microscopy

For square glass coverslips and however many wells you think you can fit on top of it.
Includes spots for you to add magnets to apply firm pressure to seal the well-insert to the coverslip.
Includes tracks for you to add a gasket (make your own from PDMS or cut rubber sheet etc)

When assembled with the plug-lid, sample volume and exposure to the atmosphere are reduced. This can help with prolonging the life of oxygen-scavenging enzyme buffers. Here a coverslip is shown in the assembled chamber cross section:

Wall thickness can be modified to optimise the space:
